Initial work to wrap dbgeng.dll with FFI. The key to the project is the FakeCOM class, which allows COM objects to be accessed through Ruby without the hefty comtypes style approach of registering DLLs and such.

Currently working:
* General wrapping, non-callback based, local and remote (via DRb)
* Callback support, local only
* IDebugBreakpoint wrapped via Breakpoint class
* x86 only

To do (LOTS)
* Gradually expand sugar in the lowlevel API (not the Raw API)
* Get callbacks working via DRb
* Add x64 support (need 64 bit MRI / FFI)

Alpha release, "it works for me" quality.

NOTE: If the whole thing fails to work you might need to manually set DEBUGGER_PATH in raw_buggery.rb, especially if you have installed the debugging tools somewhere weird.

NOTE: Unless you install the gem with the --development option, trollop will not be installed, and some of the examples and the DRb server depend on it.
