Initial work to wrap dbgeng.dll with FFI. The key to the project is the FakeCOM class, which allows
COM objects to be accessed through Ruby without the hefty comtypes style approach of registering
DLLs and such.

Currently working:
* General wrapping, non-callback based, local and remote (via DRb)
* Callback support, in local process only
* IDebugBreakpoint wrapped via Breakpoint class
* x86 in MRI and JRuby
* x64 seems to work with RubyInstaller 2.0p451 x64 and JRuby 1.7.12
* Pseudo registers
* Remote and Local kernel debugging

To do
* Get callbacks working via DRb?

NOTE: Set the DEBUGGER_PATH environment variable to the root directory of your
debugging tools.

NOTE: For local kernel debugging you MUST follow the instructions in
README_LOCAL_KERNEL

You can get the debugging tools here:
http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/debugtoolswindows/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=4912

Otherwise, you need to install the SDK for your platform and install the tools
as part of that ( you CAN unselect everything except the debugging tools )
